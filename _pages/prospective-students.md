Thank you for your interest in my research. Please note that I receive a large number of emails daily inquiring about a position in my research group. To help me make the most of my time, please email me following the template below if you are interested in joining my research team. 

Due to the overwhelming mass of emails and the lack of time, I cannot respond to every inquiry. Emails not following the procedure described below may not receive a response.

### Subject 

Please write the subject of your email in the following format:  
`Potential [Degree] applicant for [Starting date]`  
where [Degree] is the degree you are applying for and [Starting date] is the date at which you plan to start your study. For example, if you are applying to start a Ph.D. in September 2024, the subject would be:  
`Potential Ph.D. applicant for September 2024`

### Body

Begin the body of your email with the following points (in bullet form, before anything else): 

- Scanned copies of (unofficial) transcripts are attached [Don't forget to attach the undergraduate, and graduate ones, if any]
- Curriculum vitae is attached [Attach your CV]
- Master's thesis and undergraduate capstone project report are attached [Attach all those that apply to your case. For example, if you are applying for Ph.D., then attach both or include a link to both, whereas if you are applying to a Master degree, then an undergraduate capstone project report is sufficient]
- Financial situation: [Explain how you plan to finance your study]

After these bullets, you are free to elaborate on your request. For example, tell me what is driving you towards my line of research, whether you thought already of a research plan, etc.
